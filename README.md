## Description

This project implements a robust and scalable face recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system can detect faces in images, extract facial features, and match them to known faces in a database. It can be used for various applications, including security systems, user authentication, and personalized experiences.

## Features

* Face Detection: Locates faces in images with high accuracy.

* Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a database of known individuals.

* Real-time Processing: Capable of real-time face recognition from video streams.

* Database Management: Easily add, update, or delete known faces in the database.
